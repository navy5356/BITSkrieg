Problem Statement:
Floods and droughts are two disasters that can best be mitigated by an effective prediction and warning system. 
The current scenario in most places invloves the use of warning systems as well as media coverage to bring awareness to people in affected areas.
Many times, there is no means to predict and warn people in imminent danger beforehand.

Our Solution:
Bhuvan is a software application developed by ISRO which allows users to explore a 2D/3D representation of the surface of the Earth. 
The browser is specifically tailored to view India, offering the highest resolution in the country. Moreover, the images
produces by the satellite are periodically updated, providing near real-time data. 

Our solution can be divided into two parts

1. Predicting a natural disaster:
A sudden change in the size of a water body is usually a clear indication of the onset of a flood or drought in an area. 
The satellite imagery can be utilised to monitor periodically the size of water bodies in India.
Any drastic change in the same will then be flagged by our program, as the first indicator of a flood or drought, as the case may be.
This is particularly useful in the case of small scale disasters which fly under the radar in terms of media coverage and exposure.

2. Flow prediction and warning from gradient data:
In the case of floods, water flow is markedly influenced by the terrain in the region.
Once an area begins to get inundated, as seen in the satellite imagery, it could be possible to predict the areas most prone to be hit by the flood next.
Using terrain and meterological data, we propose to predict the direction of flow of water.
Thus, it is possible to alert the people in such areas, acting as a early-warning system.

3. Assisting relief efforts:
Urban settlement data superimposed on the impacted areas can provide a clearer picture for authorities on how best to direct disaster relief efforts and resources.

4. Analysing social media data:
A Natural Language Processing algorithm can be used to monitor social media feeds to collect information from people in affected areas which will also help in providing real time updates to interested parties.


Conclusion:
By bringing together openly available data and the power of cloud computing from Azure, we aim to provide a more efficient disaster prediction and mitigation system that could potentially save many lives.
